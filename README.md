ðŸ“„ Project Description
This project is a RESTful API built with Spring Boot to help manage the inventory of a newly established pharmacy. 
The goal is to simplify the organization, tracking, and maintenance of pharmaceutical products. 
The API allows the pharmacy owner to:

--Add new products with details like name, quantity, price, and description (ID generated automatically)

--Update existing product information such as stock quantity or pricing

--Delete products that are outdated or no longer needed

--View the complete list of available products in the inventory

--The solution ensures a smooth and efficient way to keep the pharmacyâ€™s stock up-to-date and well-organized.
